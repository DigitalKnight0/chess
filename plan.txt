So the plan up until now was to somehow make the methods of the king

so far i have done
-> Making movements for pieces (stable)
-> Making a method to check for if the king is under attack (Stable)
-> Getting all the possible moves of the opponent (Seems stable)

next up 

I need a method to trim off the moves of the king that can put it in check
update: done! had to make deep copies between the dummy and the grid
Hopefully the garbage collecter won't mind too much lol!

next up 

Ok so we are pretty much done with the king, but but but, we need to also refine the moves 
of each piece to see if any move made is illegal and leaves the king behind in check
ok so 
my basic idea is to do something similar to what i did with my king
upon selection, i will trim off all the moves of the pieces lol 
update: 
done! the method complexity is really getting outta hands for some of the methods but
at this stage i wanna just get this running lol 

ok i am gonna make some edits on the next moves method, let's see if i can 
reduce the no of arguments to 1
update: nope can't, just realized the location is stored by the cell object lol

I have one more method left now regarding checks, when the king is in check, i 
need to determine, that the selected piece can make a move that will rescue
the king
